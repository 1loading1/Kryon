* When you generate the Block Ram, please unchoose 'Primitives Output Register' in Vivado. Do not choose any Output Register!!
* In CCAL.v make sure you choose 'Fill Remaining Memory Locations', and set the value to 0. These Rams' init value has to be 0.
* Before run simulation, put the 'tb1.txt' to the right location, and you will find output .txt files in that right location.
